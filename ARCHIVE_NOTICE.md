# 🏛️ ARCHIVE NOTICE

## This repository has been archived

**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Reason:** Script contains obsolete and potentially dangerous code for modern macOS systems

## ⚠️ Do NOT use this script

This macOS cleanup script was designed for older macOS versions and contains:

- **Deprecated system commands** that no longer exist
- **Unsafe practices** that can cause data loss
- **Security risks** incompatible with modern macOS protections

## 📅 Historical Context

This script represents development practices from an era when:
- Manual system maintenance was more common
- macOS required more user intervention for cleanup
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) was less comprehensive

## ✅ Modern Alternatives (2025)

Instead of this archived script, use:

### Built-in macOS Tools
- **Storage Management**: Apple Menu > About This Mac > More Info > Storage Settings
- **Automatic maintenance**: Runs daily without user intervention
- **Time Machine**: For proper, safe backups

### Third-party Applications
- **CleanMyMac X**: Professional system cleaner
- **OnyX**: Free maintenance and customization tool
- **DaisyDisk**: Visual disk space analyzer

### Command Line (Advanced Users)
- `sudo periodic daily weekly monthly` - Run maintenance scripts
- `brew cleanup` - Clean Homebrew caches
- `xcrun simctl delete unavailable` - Clean Xcode simulators

## 🎓 Educational Value

This repository remains available for:
- Learning about macOS system internals
- Understanding deprecated macOS commands
- Studying evolution of macOS administration practices
- Reference for what NOT to do in modern scripts
